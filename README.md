# Duino-Coin PC Miner 4.3

This repository packages the official Duino-Coin PC miner script (`PC_Miner.py`) and its Python dependencies for version 4.3.

## Getting started
1. Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

The miner will prompt for configuration details on first launch and downloads language translations from the upstream Duino-Coin repository as needed.
